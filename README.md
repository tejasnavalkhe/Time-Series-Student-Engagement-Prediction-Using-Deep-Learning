# Time-Series-Student-Engagement-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning


## About Project:

• To efficiently address the time series analysis problem, Calculated difference between datetime values into second-based intervals.

• Utilised Normalization with MinMaxScaler to scale the data into a specific range.

• Transformed the time series analysis problem into a supervised learning problem using a sliding window approach.

• Built a neural network with several GRU, LSTM, and BatchNormalization layers and the ‘relu’ activation function along with the ‘Adam’ optimizer. Achieved a low mean absolute error of 0.00098% during evaluation.
